          Hello! My name is Bryce Lucas, I am a junior at Oakland University
          studying for my bachelor's in Information Technology. I've had a
          passion for technology and computers since I was a teenager. I built
          my first computer in 2016 and have built and upgraded many more since
          then. My passion for computers mainly stems from the hardware side of
          things. I have been interning in IT for over 3 years now gaining
          invaluable experience in the field and obtaining a better
          understanding of the day-to-day operations and struggles in the
          corporate and educational realm of IT. I aspire to get an IT or
          Cybersecurity position at a reputable university or in the car
          industry locally here in Detroit.
