      <p>
        Hello! My name is Bryce Lucas, I am a junior at Oakland University
        studying for my bachelors in Information Technology. I've had a passion
        for technology and computers since I was a teenager. I built my first
        computer in 2016 and have built and upgraded many more since then. My
        passion for computers mainly stems from the hardware end of things. I
        have been interning in IT for over 3 years now gaining invaluable
        experience in the field and obtaining a better understanding of the day
        to day operations and struggles in the corporate and educational realm
        of IT. I aspire to get an IT or Cybersecurity position at a reputable
        university or in the car industry locally here in Detroit.
